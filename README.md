# RoHM
## Robust Human Motion Reconstruction via Diffusion
#### [Project Page](https://sanweiliti.github.io/ROHM/ROHM.html) | [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08570) 


RoHM is a novel diffusion-based motion model that, conditioned on **noisy and occluded input** data, reconstructs complete, plausible motions in **consistent global coordinates**.
-- we **decompose it into two sub-tasks** and learn two models, one for global trajectory and one for local motion. 
To capture the correlations between the two, we then introduce **a novel conditioning module**, combining it with an iterative inference scheme.
